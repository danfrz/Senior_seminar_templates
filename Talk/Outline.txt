Talk Outline


Establish the topic and where we're going with it.

Establish needed concepts
	What's a Thread!
		What does a program that is multi-threaded look like?

	What is parallelism?
		What does a program that is highly parallel look like?

Thread scheduling and load-balancing on Linux
		Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)
		Cache and scheduling domains on NUMA systems/
		Load balancing algorithm for CFS
	
Transition: Frequent important scheduler requirement changes caused by new hardware lead to a scheduler with incredible complexity. (reword)

Four bugs in the load balancer, fixing them improves efficiency
	Group Imbalance bug
	Scheduling Group Construction bug
	Overload-on-Wakeup bug
	Missing Scheduling Domains bug
	
Transition/Lemma: Introduce Locks and how lock contention is a problem
for efficiency on multicore systems. Introduce concept of locality (locality)

FLSCHED: The lockless thread scheduler
	What is the Xeon Phi manycore processor?
	What problem did the researchers find?
	How FLSCHED improves the problem / Results

Transition/Lemma: Establish how a multi-processor multicore system differs from a single-processor multicore system
	
Shuffler: Cache locality improvements via thread migration
	How Shuffler goes about thread migration and how it improves locality
	Shuffler Results
